To-do list:
- Logging: add persistence, level, timestamps, more logs (bot startup/shutdown, etc)
- Refactor:  commands into modules
- item command: when not found suggest similarly named items
- Refactor: move scraping login to separate file, add params (url + map to store into)
- clean up package.json
